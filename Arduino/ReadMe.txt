I have put all the arduino code into one arduino sketch

Disclaimer: A lot of the code is inspired by or copied from the nox robot project and james bruton

The encoder interrupt code is from the example code that came with the motors 

This code wont compile unless it is on an unbuntu machine which has the ROSserial package installed and setup correctly
